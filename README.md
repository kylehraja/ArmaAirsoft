# ArmaAirsoft
A product landing page of a fake company I created. Built using HTML and CSS. The web page includes various airsoft items, their descriptions, and prices. The content on the page was arranged using flexbox properties. An iframe element is used to add a Youtube video on Airsoft. 
Media queries are also coded to handle different viewports.
